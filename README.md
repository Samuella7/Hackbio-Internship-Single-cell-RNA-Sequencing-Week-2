_ Single-Cell Genomics: A Stepping Stone for Future Immunology Discoveries

This folder contains a detailed summary of recent advances in single-cell genomics and their transformative impact on modern immunology, based on Giladi & Amit (2017).

- Folder Content

Limitations of traditional approaches: how bulk analyses mask true cellular heterogeneity.

Introduction to scRNA-seq: principles, technological innovations (microfluidics, UMIs), and advantages for high-resolution immune cell profiling.

Comparison of single-cell technologies:

Plate-based scRNA-seq

Droplet-based systems (e.g., 10x Genomics)

Combinatorial indexing

Spatial transcriptomics

Applications in immunology: discovery of new immune cell subsets, tumor–immune interactions, and infection-related responses.

Current challenges: data sparsity, cost, and computational complexity.

Future perspectives: integration of multi-omics layers, Perturb-seq, lineage tracing, and the transition toward precision immunology.

- Objective

To provide a clear and structured overview of single-cell genomics technologies and their growing role in understanding, predicting, and guiding immune system behavior.
