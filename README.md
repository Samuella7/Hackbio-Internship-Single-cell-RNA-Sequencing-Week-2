Single-Cell Genomics: A Stepping Stone for Future Immunology Discoveries

This essay contains a detailed summary of recent advances in single-cell genomics and their impact on modern immunology, based on Giladi & Amit (2017).


Essay Content

1. Limitations of Traditional Approaches

How bulk analyses can obscure true immune cell heterogeneity.

Importance of studying individual cells to uncover rare populations and transient states.


2. Introduction to scRNA-seq

Principles of single-cell RNA sequencing.

Key innovations such as microfluidics, UMIs, and high-throughput sequencing.

Complementary methods: CyTOF, index sorting, spatial transcriptomics.


3. Comparison of Single-Cell Technologies

Plate-based scRNA-seq: full-length transcripts, limited throughput.

Droplet-based systems (e.g., 10x Genomics): high throughput, lower per-cell transcript coverage.

Combinatorial indexing: enables profiling of millions of cells.

Spatial transcriptomics: preserves spatial context within tissues.


4. Applications in Immunology

Identification of new immune cell subsets (e.g., disease-associated microglia).

Advances in understanding tumor–immune interactions and infection-related responses.


5. Current Challenges

Data sparsity, experimental cost, and computational complexity.


6. Future Perspectives

Integration of multi-omics layers (transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic).

Perturb-seq, CRISPR-based screens, and lineage tracing.

Movement toward predictive and precision immunology.


Objective

To provide a clear and structured overview of single-cell genomics technologies and their growing role in understanding, predicting, and guiding immune system behavior.
