# Slide 1: Limits of Traditional Immunology Approaches
- Traditional methods relied on bulk cell analysis, masking immune cell diversity.
- Giladi & Amit (2017): Single-cell genomics reveals immune complexity at an unprecedented level.
- Benefits of single-cell analysis:
  - Identification of rare cell types
  - Capture of transient cell states
  - Observation of dynamic tissue interactions

# Slide 2: Emergence and Advantages of scRNA-seq
- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq): central to recent advances.
- Key improvements:
  - Microfluidics
  - Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)
  - High-throughput sequencing
- Complementary methods:
  - CyTOF (protein levels)
  - Index sorting
  - Spatial transcriptomics (cell location within tissues)

# Slide 3: Overview of Single-Cell Technologies
- Different scRNA-seq methods:
  - Plate-based: full-length transcript coverage, limited cell number.
  - Droplet-based (e.g., 10x Chromium): high throughput, less per-cell info.
  - Combinatorial indexing: millions of cells.
  - Spatial transcriptomics: physical cell location.
- Method choice depends on study goals, cost, resolution.

# Slide 4: Advantages and Challenges of scRNA-seq
- Advantages:
  - Greater sensitivity and resolution than traditional assays.
  - New immune cell subsets identified (e.g., microglia in Alzheimer’s).
  - Insights into tumor-immune and infection responses.
- Challenges:
  - Data sparsity
  - High cost
  - Computational complexity

# Slide 5: Future Directions in Single-Cell Genomics
- Integrating multiple biological layers:
  - Transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics.
- Technologies:
  - CRISPR-based Perturb-seq
  - Lineage tracing
- Goal:
  - Reconstruct immune lineages
  - Predict and guide therapeutic outcomes
